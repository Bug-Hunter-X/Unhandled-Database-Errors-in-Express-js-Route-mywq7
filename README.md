# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  failure to handle potential errors during database operations within route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows an incomplete route that correctly handles a 404 (user not found) but omits error handling for database issues. The solution (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to properly address these errors.

## Problem
The provided Express.js route fetches user data based on an ID.  If a user isn't found, a 404 response is returned. However, it doesn't account for errors that might arise during the database query itself (e.g., connection issues, malformed queries).  This can lead to unexpected application crashes or cryptic error messages for the client.

## Solution
The solution uses `try...catch` blocks to wrap the database interaction.  Any errors thrown during the query are caught, logged (for debugging), and a proper error response (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) is sent to the client.  This makes the application more robust and provides better feedback to users.
